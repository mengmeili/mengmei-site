Hi, I’m Mengmei Li — a former language educator turned SaaS support specialist, now building my path into strategic design and data analysis.

I write work reflections because I genuinely enjoy every job I’ve done — from banking assistant and advertising copywriter, to education, and even running an independent online English teaching studio for four years. Now based in the UK, I work as a support specialist at a SaaS company.

These reflections aren’t just personal notes — they’re an invitation. I share them in the hope that they connect with others, and maybe even spark conversation with people who think and build in similar ways.

At first glance, these roles may seem unrelated. But in each one, I’ve noticed the same thing: how recurring questions point to deeper gaps, how small, thoughtful changes improve the whole, and how surface-level issues often reveal system-level problems.

These experiences taught me to look beyond solutions — to understand how problems form, and how thoughtful design prevents them from repeating.

**Design is leverage. Systems are the result.**

I believe in the power of insight — not just to solve problems, but to redesign the conditions that create them.

I'm currently exploring:

- How design can improve user experience and empower behavior change
- How AI and data analysis can enhance learning, workflows, and self-service
- How to cook authentic Chinese food in a very non-Chinese kitchen

I'm also teaching myself to code — not just to build, but to understand how systems speak.

This site is where I reflect, write, and build.

Thanks for reading.
